<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>TinyMCE is SUPER easy to put in a CI view. You just have to add the TinyMCE to your site, say in &lsquo;scripts/tinymce&rsquo; folder. Then add a link to the file in the header of your web page, and set up the TinyMCE init (if you have special wants needs.) You may want to edit TinyMCE's config file as well to your liking.</p>
